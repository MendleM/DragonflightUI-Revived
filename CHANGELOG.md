# Changelog

DragonflightUI Revived — the community-maintained continuation of
DragonflightUI Classic, picking up after upstream's last release (v0.40.3,
May 2026). Current builds report version `0.41.0-revived1`.

Everything before v0.40.3 is in
[upstream's releases](https://github.com/Karl-HeinzSchneider/WoW-DragonflightUI/releases).

## Revived (26 July 2026)

### Movable windows (new)

- The character pane, trade window, inspect, quest log, spellbook and talent
  window can be dragged by their title bar, and stay where you put them
- Settings → Misc → **Movable Windows**, with a Reset button that hands every
  window back to the game's own placement
- Windows you never move are left exactly where the game puts them. A window
  only stops taking part in the game's window arranging once you have moved it
  — which is also what lets it stay open alongside the others, so the character
  pane and trade window can finally sit side by side

### Errors and combat blocks

- Fixed the error when casting certain spells
- Fixed the error when using a consumable in combat
- Fixed "action blocked" spam when hovering or clicking your action bars mid-fight
- Fixed the stutter caused by `#showtooltip [@mouseover]` macros. An earlier
  attempt at this broke casting and was pulled; it is back now without that
  side effect

### Action bars

- Action buttons stuck greyed out until you moused over them
- Bars 6–8 unresponsive on TBC and refusing dragged spells
- Micro menu and bag bar: hide, transparency and mouseover settings now
  actually apply
- The bag bar's expand arrow does something

### Party frames

- Class colour and gradient options work on the new party frames
- Health bars no longer stuck washed-out, and no longer dimmed by Blizzard
  over the top of our styling
- Correct power bar art
- Frame art sits behind the bars instead of over them
- Names truncate before the role icon and stay on one line
- Debuff row moved off the power bar
- Status text sized to fit the bar
- Party frames have their own settings page, edit mode entry and move handle
- Our styling can no longer break Blizzard's own party frame update loop

### Loot rolls

- Rebuilt on retail's actual loot roll frame
- Retail need/greed/pass icons instead of the classic dice and coin
- Preview button and real customization options in settings
- The preview shows a full drop, with working tooltips over it
- Adjustable gap between stacked rolls
- Fixed the restyle aborting partway, which was also taking the whole UI
  module down with it

### Edit mode

- Fixed frames disappearing when you left edit mode and only returning after
  a reload
- Fixed frames resetting to the wrong position after login or a loading screen
- Leaving edit mode only hides frames that exist purely to be dragged
- Frames with nothing to show get a labelled placeholder you can grab
- Only one edit mode open at a time — opening Blizzard's closes ours, and the
  other way round
- Closing edit mode during combat no longer makes it reopen by itself when the
  fight ends

### Nameplates

- Nameplate style is a real setting, and applies live without a reload
- Fixed a second level number appearing on styles that already have one
- Fixed level placement so it matches each style

### Chat

- The chat window can be selected and moved in DFUI's edit mode
- Chat no longer stretched or shunted around by Blizzard's edit mode
- Fixed tabs past the first rendering shifted upward when chat sits at the
  bottom of the screen
- An undocked tab can no longer be dragged off the screen and lost
- The combat log's filter bar no longer covers your other chat tabs

### Character pane

- The Dragonflight paperdoll artwork shows only on the Character tab, instead
  of bleeding onto Reputation, Skills and Pet
- The border around the model area is treated as paperdoll art too, so it no
  longer floats behind the skill list

### Reloading in combat

- One clear message instead of several, and everything the fight blocked is
  re-applied once combat ends
- An on-screen panel explains why the UI looks half-built, rather than a chat
  line that is easy to miss mid-pull

### Settings and reporting

- Bug reports show a real version number instead of `@project-version@`
- Turned-off features are marked "(off)" and can be switched back on from
  their own page, instead of being dead greyed-out entries
- The quest tracker can be disabled without disabling the whole Minimap module
- The settings window can be dragged by its header
- New `/df log` debug log, which records errors and blocked actions to disk so
  bug reports can include a real log

## Classic Era 1.15.9 support (22–25 July 2026)

The 1.15.9 patch replaced the Classic Era interface with a backport of the
modern one — Blizzard Edit Mode, retail-style action bars, pooled party
frames — which broke most of the addon. This update is the overhaul for it,
and also adds support for TBC 2.5.6 and MoP 5.5.4.

### Loading and stability

- The addon no longer half-loads and gives up partway through login
- The interface no longer visibly builds itself piece by piece for a second
  after you log in
- Reloading mid-fight finishes the job the moment combat ends, instead of
  leaving the UI half native
- Fixed the quest tracker freezing the game
- Fixed a wave of errors from interface pieces the patch removed

### Action bars

- Page arrows on the main bar work again, cycle all 6 pages, and keep working
  in combat
- The page number next to them updates again
- Shift-scrolling to change pages no longer strobes between two pages
- Keybinds on bars 6–8 fired nothing
- Bars 6–8 showed every spell twice
- Bar backgrounds were missing entirely
- Empty slots show while you are dragging a spell, and a vacated slot updates
  immediately
- Added the retail main bar frame, with an adjustable darkness setting for the
  fill behind the buttons
- Pet bar restored to its proper size, with correct highlight, active and
  autocast art
- The taxi and vehicle exit button uses the retail round arrow and sits at the
  end of the main bar instead of floating mid-screen
- Micro menu and bag bar line up with each other properly
- Fixed the garbled guild button and the stray green square in the micro menu

### Raid and hover performance

- Fixed the big one: frame skips and stutter when moving the mouse across raid
  frames
- Buff timers no longer churn the garbage collector every frame
- The character stats panel no longer listens to events for every unit in the
  world
- Keeps Questie's raid safeguards working when the client cuts its startup
  short, a major source of raid frame drops

### Nameplates (new)

- New Nameplates module: Dragonflight-styled enemy plates, outlined names and
  class-coloured enemy players

### Party and unit frames

- Full Dragonflight restyle for the new pooled party frames, including
  portraits, role icons and frame art
- Pet buffs and pet happiness restored
- Fixed the target frame's reaction-coloured bar hanging around
- Unit frame positions survive Blizzard's layout applications

### Character pane

- Retail Dragonflight pane background, and the plates framing your gear
  columns
- Restored the slot frame art and the border around the model
- Weapon row centred properly, with the ammo slot and arrow placed correctly
  for classes that use one

### Loot rolls

- Rebuilt on the real Dragonflight loot roll, replacing the classic-looking
  one
- Live tally of what everyone has picked while the roll is running
- Winner announced when it resolves

### Buffs

- Buff and debuff timers keep their real remaining time across a reload,
  instead of restarting at full
- Fixed doubled buffs

### Minimap and misc

- Minimap sits in the corner at a sane default size
- XP bar tooltip works again
